Text-based Adventure Game

Developed on Windows using Visual Studio.

Murray must attend the biggest party ever but he cannot leave his house because the door is locked and he has no keys. He must find a way out. Help him!

The development of this game in currently in a halt due to other projects. The main code is already done and it's playable until a point. The only thing remaining is filling the rest of the descriptions, accessible places and objects. 

This means that there is not much algorithmics pending except for something I might have not considered or neglected.

I'm fully aware that the code makes excessive use of pointers. Basically that's because I wanted to gain more insight about what they truly are for the compiler and how the compiler manages them.

To test the game: 
	- Compile & Run
	- Type "help" to know the basics
